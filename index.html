      <p class="left-paragraph"> In this project, my objective was to showcase the evolution of music across different eras. Rather than focusing solely on chart-topping anthems, I handpicked compositions that resonated with the cultural undercurrents and societal movements of their respective times. By doing so, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how music intertwined with the prevailing sentiments, struggles, and aspirations of various eras.</p>
    <div id="canvasContainer"></div>
    <p class="right-paragraph">Each meticulously curated composition serves as a poignant commentary on the struggles against racism, sexism, and the consequences of misguided foreign policies and interventions. We bear witness to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of oppression, discrimination, and the failures of governance that have betrayed the trust of the people. From the haunting melodies that echo the anguish of racial prejudice to the defiant rhythms that challenge gender-based inequalities. Moreover, the project casts a critical lens on the interventionist policies and foreign entanglements that have shaped the course of nations. </p>
